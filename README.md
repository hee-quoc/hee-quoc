**`Nerd AI healthcare Coder (Biomedical Engineer/Graphic Designer Potato)`**

As an indie AI Engineer and Graphic Designer, I am on a journey to craft my own digital universe. Melding the boundaries between art and science, Iâ€™m driven by a passion for exploring how these two worlds interact and influence each other. Every project I undertake is a step toward realizing this vision, where creativity meets technology in ways that redefine what's possible.
